                <li>+ What is the meaning of "bonsai"?
                    <p class="none">
                        The word bonsai comes from the Japanese words "bon" (tray or pot) and "sai" (plant or tree). Together, it means "planted in a tray" or "tray planting." It refers to the art of growing and shaping miniature trees in containers to replicate the appearance of full-size trees in nature.

                <li>+ Why makes a bonsai small?
                    <p class="none">
                        1) Pruning and trimming: Regular pruning of branches and roots keeps the tree small and balanced. 2) Pot size: Planting the tree in a small container restricts its root growth, limiting the overall size. 3) Wiring: Metal wires are used to guide the tree's growth into a desired shape. 4) Controlled care: Specialized soil, water, and nutrients are provided in moderation to slow growth without compromising the tree's health.
